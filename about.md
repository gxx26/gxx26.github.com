# About

MDwiki is a CMS/Wiki **completely built in HTML5/Javascript and runs 100% on the client**. No special software installation or server side processing is required. Just upload the `mdwiki.html` shipped with MDwiki into the same directory as your markdown files and you are good to go!

Note: The website you are currently viewing is realized with MDwiki and hosted on [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/). [http://mdwiki.info](http://mdwiki.info) redirects here.

## Features

*   Built completely in Javascript/HTML5 and **does not require any local or remote installations**
*   Uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as its input markup language
*   Build on top of [jQuery](http://www.jquery.org) and [Bootstrap3](http://www.getbootstrap.com) to work cross-browser, with responsive layout
*   Extends Markdown with special [_Gimmicks_](gimmicks.md) that add rich client functions, like syntax highlighting via [hightlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/), [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/), or [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/) for geo data
*   Themeable through Bootstrap compatibility, supports all themes from [bootswatch](http://www.bootswatch.com)

## Requirements

*   Webspace (or a web server that can serve static files)
*   Any modern Webbrowser
*   [mdwiki.html](download.md) file

## How does it work?

Just drop the `mdwiki.html` available from [the download page](download.md) along with your markdown files on a webspace somewhere. You can pass any url (relative to the `mdwiki.html` file) to mdwiki after the hashbang `#!`:

    <span class="hljs-label">http:</span>//www.example.com/mdwiki.html<span class="hljs-preprocessor">#!myfile.md</span>
    `</pre>

    If you rename the `mdwiki.html` into `index.html`, you can omit the filename on most webservers:

    <pre>`<span class="hljs-label">http:</span>//www.example.com/<span class="hljs-preprocessor">#!myfile.md</span>
    `</pre>

    MDwiki will load a file called `index.md` from the same directory as the index.html by default, so if you use an `index.md` file as entry point, all you have to do is enter your domain name:

    <pre>`<span class="hljs-string">http:</span><span class="hljs-comment">//example.com/</span>

Note: There are lots more features over regular Markdown, check out the [quickstart tutorial](quickstart.md).
